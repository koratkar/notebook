2023-01-07: success is totally made up by the way

Adults in guidance positions often talk about success as if it was embedded in the structure of the universe. It kind of isn't. It's made up, and different people have different definitions of it, and you can define it for yourself. You can just decide, right now, that you're successful. Maybe some traits will be good predictors of income or status in the future, so shrewd adults can reasonably say "you'll probably be successful by the current consensus social definition." That's fine, but when they start talking as if it's *destined* to happen or that it's *intrinsic* to you (different than saying you have indicative traits of success) or saying that "all successful people have a fire within" or repeating any other vague truism, issues arise. This universe is very chaotic and random. Predictive traits are just that. *Predictive*. You can intuit some things about causality, like things fall when you drop them, but after that, it's mostly narrative nonsense. Some of the smart people you know will become rigid conformists incapable of having an interesting thought. Some of the slackers will become nauseatingly successful. What's in your hands is how you appraise it all. Happiness, satisfaction, and the giddy inner peace we imagine successful people always feel are all reached through *internal* assessments. You can learn how to change these. Success is always available to you.

2023-01-07: positive super-stimuli

The modern day super-stimuli, as mentioned in the previous post, has, I feel, largely sapped life of transcendental moments, and that most precious trust in one's own impulses to guide the way. We can combat this by creating super-stimuli which pull us in the directions we wish to go. Running while high may just be the beginning of something truly great. Maybe one day, we'll all abandon our distractions, and that pervasive boredom gnawing away at our lives from the inside. The listless blankfaced, deadeyed, disgusted scrolling and refreshing of today will end, and we will wake as if from a dream. We will go outside, we will go to church, we will read more books, we will embark on difficult, meaningful work. And it will not be by force. We will be guided by the beauty of our weapons.

2023-01-07: **stoners, look no further**

Here's all I want to accomplish as a cultural programmer:
- Inpsire someone to build a dating site for the high school (very specific goals with that, won't say them right now)
- Inspire stoners to try running while high 

Let's talk about the second one first.

Sarah Perry [reports her experiences running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html):

> The solution: superstimulus exercise, exercise that's so good you get addicted to it and have to force yourself to do less of it than you want to. My thesis is that running while high on weed is just this kind of superstimulus exercise. 

> It makes you free. You can go anywhere, and it makes the city feel like your territory. Running while high is an excellent mode of exploration; as a runner, you occupy a well-understood role that is both socially approved and socially ignored. It's the perfect disguise to enable an introvert to move around the world in the sunshine. You can go almost anywhere, even blatantly trespassing, and no one says anything because they barely notice you except to think that they should really start running, too. 
> It's engaging, especially trail running - an ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest, avoiding all the trees efficiently and with perfect concentration.
> It's insanely pleasurable, with every part of your body screaming (in chemicals) that this coordinated motion is exactly what you're supposed to be doing. (Which ties in with the recent discovery that endocannabinoids are probably what causes runner's high. It feels to me like weed jump-starts the process of experiencing exercise as pleasurable, which, even as a life-long athlete, I experienced as much less pleasurable before becoming a stoner.)
> It's transcendent - it often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void," as Haruki Murakami puts it. 

If you are not a stoner, **do not try this**. If you are on the cross country team, **do not try this** (you will get kicked off). If you are me, you will **not be trying this**, since weed has been documented to reduce cognitive performance longterm, and I need that for other reasons. If, however, you have a propensity to behave illicitly, then nothing I say would stop you, no? So why not **try it**? "An ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest." "It often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void"." **Why are you alive**, if not for these chance moments of communion with the alien minds beneath our feet, of obliteration of the self, of union with Who lives upstairs? Some make the case that such moments were commonplace for our ancestors. There existed no need for an industrial spiritual complex to facillitate them (or, rather, to commoditize, and in so doing, *own* them). Such moments are your birth right. You lived in blissful harmony with the universe as a baby and a child, but you have forgotten how to do this without instruction. The knowledge was wretched from your soft hands so that you would live in lockstep with mankind. They have made a veil, and it is an iron curtain. 

The thing about iron curtains is that they are heavy. They cannot be moved so easily. If you find a way to walk around one, you have found free access to the worlds beyond. Free access is between your finger tips, burning at one end. Free access is your feet rhythmically contacting the ground, melting your corrosive attachments away, stride by stride. 

So. **Hit that blunt, and get outside**, won't you please?

2023-01-07: hello world

If anything, I want this to be an experiment in cultural programming. I don't want to know how many people are reading it, and I don't want to alter anything to appease an abstract audience. I do want to take some the mental models I've made to interpret the world, and install them on your brain. I want to try to cast spells and talk to the spirits that live on the mimetic substrate. Computer programming, as Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman brilliantly put it in their introductory computer science textbook, is the art of instructing magical spirits on a higher plane of existence to do your bidding. With enough computational power available, good programmers are gods. Writing is the same, but with the more ambigous world of distributed thought – culture. Ours is the substrate of mimesis, and we have direct write access into the souls of humans. Slick words can kill a man: show him the world anew through the right nihilistic lens, and he will die by his own hand. Words can imbue meaning into what is just sound and fury, and keep alive those living lives not worth living. They say this skill is innate, that you can't get better. Maybe they're right. Maybe I don't have the talent to pull this off. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm too autistic to do it anyway. Regardless, I'm going to try. 

What do I want to program? Nothing much. Only whatever in the written word constitutes hello worlds and simple binary exploits. I am not malevolent, just curious. Can I create new phrases? A new snowclone! A new cliché! Can I inspire in you doubt in your mental constructs? Hope in what is not real? I do not want to convince you of anything. Argumentation is not programming, but some kind of cultural API layer. 

Let us see where we can take this! Share this page with your friends!
