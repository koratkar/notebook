If anything, I want this to be an experiment in cultural programming. I don't want to know how many people are reading it, and I don't want to alter anything to appease an abstract audience. I do want to take some the mental models I've made to interpret the world, and install them on your brain. I want to try to cast spells and talk to the spirits that live on the mimetic substrate. Computer programming, as Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman brilliantly put it in their introductory computer science textbook, is the art of instructing magical spirits on a higher plane of existence to do your bidding. With enough computational power available, good programmers are gods. Writing is the same, but with the more ambigous world of distributed thought – culture. Ours is the substrate of mimesis, and we have direct write access into the souls of humans. Slick words can kill a man: show him the world anew through the right nihilistic lens, and he will die by his own hand. Words can imbue meaning into what is just sound and fury, and keep alive those living lives not worth living. They say this skill is innate, that you can't get better. Maybe they're right. Maybe I don't have the talent to pull this off. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm too autistic to do it anyway. Regardless, I'm going to try. 

What do I want to program? Nothing much. Only whatever in the written word constitutes hello worlds and simple binary exploits. I am not malevolent, just curious. Can I create new phrases? A new snowclone! A new cliché! Can I inspire in you doubt in your mental constructs? Hope in what is not real? I do not want to convince you of anything. Argumentation is not programming, but some kind of cultural API layer. 

Let us see where we can take this! Share this page with your friends!
