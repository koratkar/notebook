2023-01-08: walk through the walls

There are some people who are endlessly fascinating. Behind their eyes and between their ears lies a generator of a world like no other. Usually these people are slightly autistic or schizoid or *off* in some way. The prerequisite isn’t their psychiatric classification, but their deviance in how they see things. Most people are handed by society an idea of how other people work, what to believe, what is meaningful, what is virtuous behavior, what they are, and, crucially, what to do. These people are often uninteresting, and mostly so when they’re intelligent. Modern suburban childhood is a very ludic terrarium for developing new white collar workers. The smarter someone is without weird traits, the more likely it is that they’ll overfit to this low-poly simulation of real life. And succeed they will, but see they will not. They’ll follow their innate priors about the world and human behavior, never questioning them – because they work – and they will only ever know things from one view point. If their instincts and innate priors do not guide them well, or if they fail to download social software, they divert more attention to the world around them. Without conditioning tinting their vision, they see things as they are, and come to drastically different conclusions about their environment. 

I want to resist classifying this kind of person, because fitting into a category is precisely what they best fail at, but this is generally what I find makes someone *interesting*. 

Surrounding you are walls. Holding your head is a clamp, stifling attempts to really see. The world you live in often lies to you. I think liberation is finding ways of repurposing the features of your environment for new functions, ones unintended by its designers – be they intelligent, nature, or social forces. See that the walls and clamp aren’t solid objects, but that they are entirely notional. Walk through them! Betray away your category, your unchosen identity. This is your world. It is an open world game much larger than the what the eye implies. Play it your way.

2023-01-08: against spurious sounding claims about things that vaguely correlate

From a PsychToday article entitled "Beautiful People Really Are More Intelligent":

> This mean difference implies a correlation coefficient of r = .381, which is reasonably large in any survey data.

Do you know what an r = .381 looks like on a graph?

Does it warrant a claim like "beautiful people are more intelligent"? My focus isn't on the truth of the statement, it's on the wording. What you say affects how other people feel, and if you say things like "thinner people live happier lives, have a better relationship to their bosses, and find cat fur to be softer" to an aneorexic, I don't think that's going to go down very well, regardless of the veracity of the statements. It's so easy to get people to obssess over their intelligence, especially nerds. When that's the only thing about you that could give you status, you're going to think about it a lot. 

I really can't guess whose going to be reading this. Most people aren't constantly thinking about their IQ, and whether it's enough SDs to the right. The people who are (myself included) can't easily unravel themselves from the ever-tightening death spiral, and tend not to be people who *should* be worrying about the implications of their IQ. Whatever self-worth means, everybody knows attractive people are treated differently, intelligent people are more capable, and immutable biological traits determine what the world looks like for you. Maybe you decide your *self-worth*, but you don't always decide your worth otherwise. Should we efface the concept of individual differences from the discourse? Let ourselves be happier rather than right? That never seems to go down well. 

I argue for something else. Let's treat everyone with kindness, even though unconciously we will treat some people more kindly. Let's join together to weather the forever-winter of our shared suffering. No one can extricate from you the horror of being a conscious being, no matter your height, weight, looks, intelligence, or charisma. No one can stop you from being an anxious control freak – well if they could, I doubt you'd care. We exist, often with no viable opt-out, and we deal with that.

2023-01-07: success is totally made up by the way

Adults in guidance positions often talk about success as if it was embedded in the structure of the universe. It kind of isn't. It's made up, and different people have different definitions of it, and you can define it for yourself. You can just decide, right now, that you're successful. Maybe some traits will be good predictors of income or status in the future, so shrewd adults can reasonably say "you'll probably be successful by the current consensus social definition." That's fine, but when they start talking as if it's *destined* to happen or that it's *intrinsic* to you (different than saying you have indicative traits of success) or saying that "all successful people have a fire within" or repeating any other vague truism, issues arise. This universe is very chaotic and random. Predictive traits are just that. *Predictive*. You can intuit some things about causality, like things fall when you drop them, but after that, it's mostly narrative nonsense. Some of the smart people you know will become rigid conformists incapable of having an interesting thought. Some of the slackers will become nauseatingly successful. What's in your hands is how you appraise it all. Happiness, satisfaction, and the giddy inner peace we imagine successful people always feel are all reached through *internal* assessments. You can learn how to change these. Success is always available to you.

2023-01-07: positive super-stimuli

The modern day super-stimuli, as mentioned in the previous post, has, I feel, largely sapped life of transcendental moments, and that most precious trust in one's own impulses to guide the way. We can combat this by creating super-stimuli which pull us in the directions we wish to go. Running while high may just be the beginning of something truly great. Maybe one day, we'll all abandon our distractions, and that pervasive boredom gnawing away at our lives from the inside. The listless blankfaced, deadeyed, disgusted scrolling and refreshing of today will end, and we will wake as if from a dream. We will go outside, we will go to church, we will read more books, we will embark on difficult, meaningful work. And it will not be by force. We will be guided by the beauty of our weapons.

2023-01-07: **stoners, look no further**

Here's all I want to accomplish as a cultural programmer:
- Inpsire someone to build a dating site for the high school (very specific goals with that, won't say them right now)
- Inspire stoners to try running while high 

Let's talk about the second one first.

Sarah Perry [reports her experiences running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html):

> The solution: superstimulus exercise, exercise that's so good you get addicted to it and have to force yourself to do less of it than you want to. My thesis is that running while high on weed is just this kind of superstimulus exercise. 

> It makes you free. You can go anywhere, and it makes the city feel like your territory. Running while high is an excellent mode of exploration; as a runner, you occupy a well-understood role that is both socially approved and socially ignored. It's the perfect disguise to enable an introvert to move around the world in the sunshine. You can go almost anywhere, even blatantly trespassing, and no one says anything because they barely notice you except to think that they should really start running, too. 
> It's engaging, especially trail running - an ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest, avoiding all the trees efficiently and with perfect concentration.
> It's insanely pleasurable, with every part of your body screaming (in chemicals) that this coordinated motion is exactly what you're supposed to be doing. (Which ties in with the recent discovery that endocannabinoids are probably what causes runner's high. It feels to me like weed jump-starts the process of experiencing exercise as pleasurable, which, even as a life-long athlete, I experienced as much less pleasurable before becoming a stoner.)
> It's transcendent - it often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void," as Haruki Murakami puts it. 

If you are not a stoner, **do not try this**. If you are on the cross country team, **do not try this** (you will get kicked off). If you are me, you will **not be trying this**, since weed has been documented to reduce cognitive performance longterm, and I need that for other reasons. If, however, you have a propensity to behave illicitly, then nothing I say would stop you, no? So why not **try it**? "An ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest." "It often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void"." **Why are you alive**, if not for these chance moments of communion with the alien minds beneath our feet, of obliteration of the self, of union with Who lives upstairs? Some make the case that such moments were commonplace for our ancestors. There existed no need for an industrial spiritual complex to facillitate them (or, rather, to commoditize, and in so doing, *own* them). Such moments are your birth right. You lived in blissful harmony with the universe as a baby and a child, but you have forgotten how to do this without instruction. The knowledge was wretched from your soft hands so that you would live in lockstep with mankind. They have made a veil, and it is an iron curtain. 

The thing about iron curtains is that they are heavy. They cannot be moved so easily. If you find a way to walk around one, you have found free access to the worlds beyond. Free access is between your finger tips, burning at one end. Free access is your feet rhythmically contacting the ground, melting your corrosive attachments away, stride by stride. 

So. **Hit that blunt, and get outside**, won't you please?

2023-01-07: hello world

If anything, I want this to be an experiment in cultural programming. I don't want to know how many people are reading it, and I don't want to alter anything to appease an abstract audience. I do want to take some the mental models I've made to interpret the world, and install them on your brain. I want to try to cast spells and talk to the spirits that live on the mimetic substrate. Computer programming, as Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman brilliantly put it in their introductory computer science textbook, is the art of instructing magical spirits on a higher plane of existence to do your bidding. With enough computational power available, good programmers are gods. Writing is the same, but with the more ambigous world of distributed thought – culture. Ours is the substrate of mimesis, and we have direct write access into the souls of humans. Slick words can kill a man: show him the world anew through the right nihilistic lens, and he will die by his own hand. Words can imbue meaning into what is just sound and fury, and keep alive those living lives not worth living. They say this skill is innate, that you can't get better. Maybe they're right. Maybe I don't have the talent to pull this off. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm too autistic to do it anyway. Regardless, I'm going to try. 

What do I want to program? Nothing much. Only whatever in the written word constitutes hello worlds and simple binary exploits. I am not malevolent, just curious. Can I create new phrases? A new snowclone! A new cliché! Can I inspire in you doubt in your mental constructs? Hope in what is not real? I do not want to convince you of anything. Argumentation is not programming, but some kind of cultural API layer. 

Let us see where we can take this! Share this page with your friends!
