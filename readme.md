2023-01-11: Tom Swifty 1/n

"I continue to believe the highest calling of man is finding novel and humorous exploitations in language." Tom puntificated.

ChatGPT wields as of today paltry powers of perversing language into new and exciting forms. When Tom Swifties are automated, alignment will be a lost cause.

2023-01-11: time again

Sarah Perry writes:

> Coordinated punctuality comes at the cost of each person living most of his hours aware of the wider world’s standard time, which is a novel way of being human.

Today's experience of time, and of wasting time, are both novel. Wasting time is a constructed phenomena – the feeling comes from a loss of opportunity for status or something akin – and we tie it to time.

4,000 weeks makes this point in more fluid prose, but I only half-heartedly flipped through the first few pages and stopped reading when the author said he wasn't time-enlightened yet.

2023-01-10: what should we do

Time as a concept is quite strange. In the moment, it's flowing so effortlessly, even counter to your efforts to stop it. You exist, and that's terrifying beyond words. Across days, it's interrupted by sleep and by dreams – which can last varying ammounts of time in the same intervals. You aren't a continuous process, and the only meaningful connection to the last moment is a sense of identification with the memory. 

This begets an important question: what is wasting time? Our motivational system calculates the best ways to fulfill our drives, and sometimes leaves us very unfulfilled beyond momentary satiation. It's using data we don't consciously have access to (eg blood sugar levels), and can cause us to act counter to our best interests. What do we have to feel bad for? What is this feeling of waste, of lost hours? There is merely memory and anticipation and in between is something that's really not that fixed. We live in a waterfall, a cascade of brown noise, and we can never hold on to the sound of one drop of water. We are puppeted by a blind idiot master program designed for savannas now long denuded of grass. How can we but dissasociate from the strings?

What's left to be done? As long as we believe we are in the abyss between a harmonious past and a coordinated future, we can continue making progress. How long can you believe you're still vexed by the brilliant delusion?

2023-01-10: enhanced school

We know that [running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html) may improve the subjective experience. My thoughts as of late have been directed towards finding ways to enhance other activities. The positive super-stimulus problem. Imagine everything you need to do that you hate doing. Now, imagine you felt euphoric while doing them. Melting away into the most banal of tasks, living a life that looks no different than yours right now, but so pleasurable you almost want to suffer again. Perhaps this can be achieved through meditation or simple exercises, such as focusing only on the pleasant aspects of an experience. Those take effort, which is exactly the hurdle. 

How may we do this for the most excrutiatingly boring of tasks: homework? Music makes it more manageable, but it does not unlock the hidden pleasures of reading the political science syllabus. Modafinil users say boring tasks suddenly become wholly absorbing on the drug, though it's not advisable to try. Alexey Guzey reports [working in a virtual office](https://guzey.com/co-working/) provides a measurable boost to his productivity. That may not be a superstimulus, but it sure is an improvement over slavishly plowing through tasks no human will ever need to do again. 

[Join me in my Gather.Town office](https://app.gather.town/invite?token=ZTl-JF5hQ52Wy2XdGk7U) if you want to try it out with me. I'll be there whenever I'm working – on anything.

2023-01-09: flat earthers

From Sam Kriss's [Neil deGrasse Tyson hit piece](https://samkriss.com/2016/03/14/neil-degrasse-tyson-pedantry-in-space/):

> But all this is pedantry, the perverse insistence on how the world is, the total apathy to how it could be different. Pedantry could be broadly defined as a hostility to metaphor, the demand that every object stand for itself and nothing else, that words function in the same way as numbers. Which is why it’s pointless to criticise Neil deGrasse Tyson or the I Fucking Love Scientists for being the pompous, self-important, and utterly cretinous pedants that they are: it’s just falling back into their own dismal, boring logic, insisting that a thing is what it is rather than something else.

Often teachers will only show you a means of symbol manipulation with some definitions: it appears that's all that happens in calculus classes. If you ask your instructor how something works, they will often tell you they don't know. You are told a set of things is supposedly true, and handed a set of instructions that supposedly work. If you believe those things, and painfully contort your brain to work with them (rather than look at them from new directions, and mold them into the perfect shape for understanding to strike you – an approach that may not always result in high scores), they will pin many bright ribbons on your lapel. 

Flat earthers challenge this paradigm. They only accept what they see with their own eyes. They are the last champions of the truth, the last brave souls willing to leave a paradise of pure abstraction and aribtrary facts tagged true by Smart People to enter the triple inferno of Not Knowing, Not Trusting, and Uncertainty. We may never know, and with this crippling fact we must continue! *Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen.*

2023-01-09: improv routine

"Now we are going to take suggestions from the audience. Imagine I'm a talk show host, and my partner over here is a pop musician. What's one question I have for her? [...] Yes, you, right there, in the teal shirt!"

"Do you feel you have wasted your life in the entertainment industry, while you could have done something more useful for the world with your gifts?"

2023-01-09: walk through the walls

There are some people who are endlessly fascinating. Behind their eyes and between their ears lies a generator of a world like no other. Usually these people are slightly autistic or schizoid or *off* in some way. The prerequisite isn’t their psychiatric classification, but their deviance in how they see things. Most people are handed by society an idea of how other people work, what to believe, what is meaningful, what is virtuous behavior, what they are, and, crucially, what to do. These people are often uninteresting, and mostly so when they’re intelligent. Modern suburban childhood is a very ludic terrarium for developing new white collar workers. The smarter someone is without weird traits, the more likely it is that they’ll overfit to this low-poly simulation of real life. And succeed they will, but see they will not. They’ll follow their innate priors about the world and human behavior, never questioning them – because they work – and they will only ever know things from one view point. If their instincts and innate priors do not guide them well, or if they fail to download social software, they divert more attention to the world around them. Without conditioning tinting their vision, they see things as they are, and come to drastically different conclusions about their environment. 

I want to resist classifying this kind of person, because fitting into a category is precisely what they best fail at, but this is generally what I find makes someone *interesting*. 

Surrounding you are walls. Holding your head is a clamp, stifling attempts to really see. The world you live in often lies to you. I think liberation is finding ways of repurposing the features of your environment for new functions, ones unintended by its designers – be they intelligent, nature, or social forces. See that the walls and clamp aren’t solid objects, but that they are entirely notional. Walk through them! Betray away your category, your unchosen identity. This is your world. It is an open world game much larger than the what the eye implies. Play it your way.

2023-01-09: against spurious sounding claims about things that vaguely correlate

From a PsychToday article entitled "Beautiful People Really Are More Intelligent":

> This mean difference implies a correlation coefficient of r = .381, which is reasonably large in any survey data.

Do you know what an r = .381 looks like on a graph?

![r values](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DzwTH.png)

Does it warrant a claim like "beautiful people are more intelligent"? My focus isn't on the truth of the statement, it's on the wording. What you say affects how other people feel, and if you say things like "thinner people live happier lives, have a better relationship to their bosses, and find cat fur to be softer" to an aneorexic, I don't think that's going to go down very well, regardless of the veracity of the statements. It's so easy to get people to obssess over their intelligence, especially nerds. When that's the only thing about you that could give you status, you're going to think about it a lot. 

I really can't guess whose going to be reading this. Most people aren't constantly thinking about their IQ, and whether it's enough SDs to the right. The people who are (myself included) can't easily unravel themselves from the ever-tightening death spiral, and tend not to be people who *should* be worrying about the implications of their IQ. Whatever self-worth means, everybody knows attractive people are treated differently, intelligent people are more capable, and immutable biological traits determine what the world looks like for you. Maybe you decide your *self-worth*, but you don't always decide your worth otherwise. Should we efface the concept of individual differences from the discourse? Let ourselves be happier rather than right? That never seems to go down well. 

I argue for something else. Let's treat everyone with kindness, even though unconciously we will treat some people more kindly. Let's join together to weather the forever-winter of our shared suffering. No one can extricate from you the horror of being a conscious being, no matter your height, weight, looks, intelligence, or charisma. No one can stop you from being an anxious control freak – well if they could, I doubt you'd care. We exist, often with no viable opt-out, and we deal with that.

2023-01-07: success is totally made up by the way

Adults in guidance positions often talk about success as if it was embedded in the structure of the universe. It kind of isn't. It's made up, and different people have different definitions of it, and you can define it for yourself. You can just decide, right now, that you're successful. Maybe some traits will be good predictors of income or status in the future, so shrewd adults can reasonably say "you'll probably be successful by the current consensus social definition." That's fine, but when they start talking as if it's *destined* to happen or that it's *intrinsic* to you (different than saying you have indicative traits of success) or saying that "all successful people have a fire within" or repeating any other vague truism, issues arise. This universe is very chaotic and random. Predictive traits are just that. *Predictive*. You can intuit some things about causality, like things fall when you drop them, but after that, it's mostly narrative nonsense. Some of the smart people you know will become rigid conformists incapable of having an interesting thought. Some of the slackers will become nauseatingly successful. What's in your hands is how you appraise it all. Happiness, satisfaction, and the giddy inner peace we imagine successful people always feel are all reached through *internal* assessments. You can learn how to change these. Success is always available to you.

2023-01-07: positive super-stimuli

The modern day super-stimuli, as mentioned in the previous post, has, I feel, largely sapped life of transcendental moments, and that most precious trust in one's own impulses to guide the way. We can combat this by creating super-stimuli which pull us in the directions we wish to go. Running while high may just be the beginning of something truly great. Maybe one day, we'll all abandon our distractions, and that pervasive boredom gnawing away at our lives from the inside. The listless blankfaced, deadeyed, disgusted scrolling and refreshing of today will end, and we will wake as if from a dream. We will go outside, we will go to church, we will read more books, we will embark on difficult, meaningful work. And it will not be by force. We will be guided by the beauty of our weapons.

2023-01-07: **stoners, look no further**

Here's all I want to accomplish as a cultural programmer:
- Inpsire someone to build a dating site for the high school (very specific goals with that, won't say them right now)
- Inspire stoners to try running while high 

Let's talk about the second one first.

Sarah Perry [reports her experiences running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html):

> The solution: superstimulus exercise, exercise that's so good you get addicted to it and have to force yourself to do less of it than you want to. My thesis is that running while high on weed is just this kind of superstimulus exercise. 

> It makes you free. You can go anywhere, and it makes the city feel like your territory. Running while high is an excellent mode of exploration; as a runner, you occupy a well-understood role that is both socially approved and socially ignored. It's the perfect disguise to enable an introvert to move around the world in the sunshine. You can go almost anywhere, even blatantly trespassing, and no one says anything because they barely notice you except to think that they should really start running, too. 
> It's engaging, especially trail running - an ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest, avoiding all the trees efficiently and with perfect concentration.
> It's insanely pleasurable, with every part of your body screaming (in chemicals) that this coordinated motion is exactly what you're supposed to be doing. (Which ties in with the recent discovery that endocannabinoids are probably what causes runner's high. It feels to me like weed jump-starts the process of experiencing exercise as pleasurable, which, even as a life-long athlete, I experienced as much less pleasurable before becoming a stoner.)
> It's transcendent - it often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void," as Haruki Murakami puts it. 

If you are not a stoner, **do not try this**. If you are on the cross country team, **do not try this** (you will get kicked off). If you are me, you will **not be trying this**, since weed has been documented to reduce cognitive performance longterm, and I need that for other reasons. If, however, you have a propensity to behave illicitly, then nothing I say would stop you, no? So why not **try it**? "An ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest." "It often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void"." **Why are you alive**, if not for these chance moments of communion with the alien minds beneath our feet, of obliteration of the self, of union with Who lives upstairs? Some make the case that such moments were commonplace for our ancestors. There existed no need for an industrial spiritual complex to facillitate them (or, rather, to commoditize, and in so doing, *own* them). Such moments are your birth right. You lived in blissful harmony with the universe as a baby and a child, but you have forgotten how to do this without instruction. The knowledge was wretched from your soft hands so that you would live in lockstep with mankind. They have made a veil, and it is an iron curtain. 

The thing about iron curtains is that they are heavy. They cannot be moved so easily. If you find a way to walk around one, you have found free access to the worlds beyond. Free access is between your finger tips, burning at one end. Free access is your feet rhythmically contacting the ground, melting your corrosive attachments away, stride by stride. 

So. **Hit that blunt, and get outside**, won't you please?

2023-01-07: hello world

If anything, I want this to be an experiment in cultural programming. I don't want to know how many people are reading it, and I don't want to alter anything to appease an abstract audience. I do want to take some the mental models I've made to interpret the world, and install them on your brain. I want to try to cast spells and talk to the spirits that live on the mimetic substrate. Computer programming, as Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman brilliantly put it in their introductory computer science textbook, is the art of instructing magical spirits on a higher plane of existence to do your bidding. With enough computational power available, good programmers are gods. Writing is the same, but with the more ambigous world of distributed thought – culture. Ours is the substrate of mimesis, and we have direct write access into the souls of humans. Slick words can kill a man: show him the world anew through the right nihilistic lens, and he will die by his own hand. Words can imbue meaning into what is just sound and fury, and keep alive those living lives not worth living. They say this skill is innate, that you can't get better. Maybe they're right. Maybe I don't have the talent to pull this off. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm too autistic to do it anyway. Regardless, I'm going to try. 

What do I want to program? Nothing much. Only whatever in the written word constitutes hello worlds and simple binary exploits. I am not malevolent, just curious. Can I create new phrases? A new snowclone! A new cliché! Can I inspire in you doubt in your mental constructs? Hope in what is not real? I do not want to convince you of anything. Argumentation is not programming, but some kind of cultural API layer. 

Let us see where we can take this! Share this page with your friends!
