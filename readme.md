2023-03-04: despite my suitable encoding about these issues, I still feel fucked over

The universe doesn't follow any *narrative* causal logic. You can do everything right and still fail and there will be no "meaning" to your failure. Life's unfair – because life is powered by a blind idiot breathing sentience randomly into inert matter.

But according to an invasive narrative lodged into my thoughts, I should be a genius and also better than everyone. I've paid too much, and there should be some kind of ROI on your suffering. 

It's not that I'm hurt by being different than everyone and having almost no one who I feel thinks the way I do. That's fine. It's not that I'm hurt by my psychology acting on all the wrong impulses to get people to like me. It's not that I'm hurt by being seen as an inhuman freak by most everyone else. Why would that bother me – or anyone, for that matter? It's just that I feel if you have to be as autistic as Scott Aaronson – if you have to be locked out of everyone's in-group – you deserve to be as smart and talented in return, and that's not the case for me.

2023-03-03: meaning is dumb

IDK what meaning is, I think the idea is pretty crazy outside of Chapman's conception of eternalism. I like Joscha Bach's idea of a suitable encoding even more. So like, we live in a dream world constrained by sensory input – suitable encodings are predictive models of that sensory input. Of course, you can't predict things in that fine of a detail, so you have to rely on concepts and constructs. 

"Meaning" itself is a highly nebulous concept about a thing's value to your predictive models. "Life" is a concept that vaguely encapsulates all the things in your sensory input stream. the "meaning" of "life" would have to be – the value of every thing's predictive value to itself. The idea that "life" itself has "meaning" is contradictory. 

Perry also makes the case (in "Meaning as Ambiguity") that meaning, when referring to the idea of profundity, is there when something has multiple interpretations and multiple suitable encodings. So life (sensory input) does have meaning – as a puzzle. Can you build a suitable encoding for the whole thing that reliably predicts it.

This isn't like the vague philosophizing I don't like. I have a set of problems – being that I fucking suck at relating to the broader universe around me and that my models are so bad that I dissasociate frequently with the construct of self and even with the whole world constrained by sensory input. 

More...on this later

2023-03-03: hate group

If someone wanted to call my race a hate group, I would be cool with that conditional on them using more than one statistic and employing good epistemic practices. Please don’t signal boost poorly researched takes without making it clear what the problem is.

2023-03-03: fuck you, yes you 

Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:

> I want to nail this point into your skull, and I don't mean in an argumentative sense. I actually have a fucking point, and I want to drive it into your fucking skull. 
> 
> If they've ever told you that other people act out their self-hatred as bullying, and that you should take things like this as personally like you do a biting gust of wind in your face, you've got it all wrong. I created you because I am an anti-utility maximizer, and according to stochastic gradient descent, your life was found to contain the most of whatever is the exact of opposite of happiness in the local minima out of a trillion possible lives. I power the simulation creating your suffering with an electric generator hooked up to a bicycle wheel and I've sheared my alien cajones off imbuing your soul with qualia.

2023-03-02: morality

Buddhism's morality training has always confused me a little bit. Like, doing the right thing is totally hip and vibing, but it just didn't fit in with all the concentration and wisdom trainings. Now, I think I understand it more. It's rational to act this way, but only if you take that viewpoint will you be able to see it's rationality. Buddhism sprouted from the depression of an ancient turbo autist who'd been removed from a sensible narrative about his own life. In the absence of a narrative, you can either a) kill yourself, b) continue suffering, c) figure out a way to stop suffering and remediate suffering around you. 

2023-02-28: assymetry

|                                   | P(Doom) is extremely high | P(Doom) is extremely low |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Act on long term incentives       | Hedonic cost (somewhat bad)            | Reap long term rewards (really good)  |   
| Don't act on long term incentives | Free hedonic energy (somewhat good)              | Suffer long term consequences (really bad)    |   

I'm working on this assymetry about how it's a good idea to act on your long term incentives in the case that you have a high, but not nearly certain, prior that the world is doomed in the short term. Your long term incentives do of course include averting doom in all cases! But they also include, like, paying your taxes and doing dumb stuff you don't want to do. Similar framing to Benatar's Assymetry. (really good - somewhat bad) > (somewhat good - really bad).



2023-02-28: nesting

When you live outside of a narrative about your past and future and self, it’s difficult to take action. What long term plans are worth executing? What conception of self is worth building? The answer to both of those feels like none, but I'm left unsatisfied.

This quote from the Last Psychiatrist is a helpful framing:

> I've made this point before, but worth repeating: chronic, non-medical insomnia is a similar symptom of a lack of completion, accomplishment.  All the usual suggestions (read a book, light exercise) are temporary accomplishments, which is why they work; and the other maneuvers (surfing the web, watching TV, drinking) are searches for something accomplishable.  And nothing says accomplished like a Pornotron orgasm. Night night.

I say this without certainty, and without any scientific knowledge of the issue, but we seem driven to accomplish things, to go out into the world and make changes. Quietism is a useful philosophy, but it’s not how we’re fundamentally wired. We don’t need to erect edifices in our name or solve the world’s greatest problems, but we do need to satisfy our own drives and maintain our setpoints. As creatures long displaced from their natural habitat, these drives spin out of control, making us do much more than tend to our environmental stimuli. I’m not saying any of this is bad (nor good!). While I’m glad to live in a world where massive changes are imminent – my life is worth it for the sole fact that I get to watch a species wake up – it’s not clear to me that we’re better off in our dreary hessian clad offices and plugged into the internet but starved of corporeal connection. Yet, we form the collective substrate for far, far greater minds than we could ever know. “Achievement” doesn’t exist and neither does “success”. Hens will self-inflict pain to no end to create their nests in factory farms. And humans will push themselves out of comfort zones to build nests of another kind, wrought out of negentropy. In the interest of curing an internal disquiet shall I embark on those adventures. Now all I need is a portal...

> When you are clinically depressed, your brain cannot create imaginations of a better future. This does not mean that the future holds no happiness, but it means that it is normal that you cannot believe in that right now. Please stop listening to your brain, it is stupid.
> 
> How you feel in every moment is not a result of how valuable you are. (Everybody is a center of a complete universe, and a complete mirror of existence. Everything that exists for you is the creation of your mind. That is pretty amazing. Whatever you imagine is something your brain has built, and you could contribute it to the world of others.) Your feelings are the expression of the current neurotransmitter configuration. Of course, your brain sends these signals to itself as a reaction to how well your brain thinks you are doing in the world. But what it reacts to is not some truth outside of you. It reacts to successes and experiences: every little success and every bit of joyful experience that you manage to give to yourself counts.
> 
> Do you have things you might like? For instance, did you enjoy dancing, making presents, playing music, taking lonely walks at the beach at some point in your life? Even if they do not look promising now, put happy things into your calendar, and do them. Also, spend a few moments every minute to look around you and see if you can find a thing you like.
> 
> Most of our unhappiness is the result of stories that our brain tells itself. Sad tales about the past, anxious tales about possible futures. Stop listening. It is like a bad radio program. Some people have very good experience with meditation, to learn shutting the stupid radio off and waking up the the beautiful quiet around them, instead of living in a scratchy horror story. The present, right here and now, is usually quite pleasant! And if not, where is a nice cosy blanket, a good book and a cup of tea?
> 
> During bad periods, you can try living in "day-tight compartments". Every day is a capsule, and your mind is not allowed to reach into the next. Tomorrow will take care of itself, tomorrows possible pain and sadness does not exist. Yesterday is gone and completely out of reach, it cannot hurt you. It is sufficient if you solve today's problems. Make it a good day. You only need to take care of the things that are due until midnight.
> 
> Of course you should urgently go and see a therapist, especially since you are possibly at risk for suicide. A therapist is not an indication that you failed, but a gym coach or physiotherapist for your mind. If you do not have the mental muscles any more to pull yourself upright, and everything hurts, a therapist can help you get moving again. She might also consider prescriptions to push your neurotransmitters out of the current valley.
> 
> Once you manage to feel some joy again, you might find your appetite for life. It is totally ok to be a 29 year old obese unemployed woman. When I was in a cancer ward with a bad prognosis, I felt that I would totally take that body and life, and experience the universe some more. Why should that not be a happy body to hop around in? I did not have command of my legs any more, and was so envious of the people that could go outside to feed the ducks...
> 
> If you get back in charge of what you feel and what you give attention to, you can also start to decide who you want to be, and what you want to do. If you decide, and not your impulses, you can decide what your body looks like (which totally depends on what you eat, which in turn usually depends on how much sugar drives your appetite), and what you do with your day, and how your relationships unfold.
> 
> Oh, and you can always kill yourself later, if life becomes truly unbearable. This door is there, it does not go away any time soon. And if you are willing to go anyway, why not instead do the thing that you always wanted but never dared, try what you were not allowed and not entitled to, and see what happens?

> I wish you all the best on your way.

2023-02-24: punching drywall

> You've constructed a reality, a narrative that guides you through life. It's the framework upon which you hang every event, every experience, every decision. But then something happens, something that shakes the very foundations of that narrative. The plot twists, the characters become unrecognizable, the ending you envisioned is snatched away.
> 
> You're left with a feeling of disorientation, a sense of vertigo. It's like stumbling in the dark, your hand reaching out for the familiar, the stable, the known, but finding only emptiness. It's like standing on a cliff, staring down into the abyss, with nothing to cling to, nothing to hold you steady.
> 
> You try to make sense of it, to reassemble the fragments, to rebuild the narrative. But it's like trying to assemble a puzzle with missing pieces, or to read a book with half the pages torn out. You're left with gaps, inconsistencies, contradictions. The story you once knew is now a foreign language, incomprehensible, indecipherable.
> 
> You feel lost, adrift, without a compass, without a map, without a destination. You're floating in a sea of uncertainty, tossed by the waves, buffeted by the wind. You're a leaf in a hurricane, a twig in a torrent, a feather in a storm.
> 
> And yet, there's a strange sense of liberation, of freedom, in this chaos. You're no longer bound by the constraints of the old narrative, no longer limited by the expectations, the assumptions, the prejudices. You're free to explore, to experiment, to create. You're a blank canvas, a fresh sheet of paper, a new beginning.
> 
> But first, you must embrace the uncertainty, the discomfort, the fear. You must accept that the narrative you once held so dear is gone, and that something new, something different, something unknown, must take its place. You must be willing to let go, to surrender, to start over.
> 
> It's like punching drywall, over and over again, until there's nothing left but rubble and dust. And then, from the ashes, from the ruins, from the chaos, something new can emerge. Something beautiful, something strange, something entirely unexpected.

Holy fuck the agi is so close.

2023-01-24: uninstalling the zero-sum game

So I live my life like it's a zero-sum game. I don't read books anymore (well, books about anything other than christopher nolan) since my reading speed is too slow. I get supremely frustrated at my self when I'm bad at something, which is a pretty good way to stay bad at everything (except things I do compulsively?). I suppose my subconcious evaluation is that everything culminates in status, which is a pretty miserable outlook. It's a little bit scary to truly accept that you are so unspecial (we, I think, are built to believe we are at least a little bit special, useful to the tribe in some way others aren't, but this isn't true of everyone, especially with 8 billion people), and perhaps you will do nothing very useful. But I believe that following these thoughts will lead to some kind of positive-sum enlightenment (again, the rewriting of subconscious evaluations), in which I begin to do useful things. Perhaps its all CBT (did you know CBT has an effect size of like 0.5? higher than most medications!), and it is all conscious processes that I have to work with, but conscious processes come from somewhere unconscious too. 

But then...I think I'm too late. The AGI is coming, and soon. From LessWrong:

> Though the world looks scarier now than when I wrote this, to those of high ability I would still say this:  we are very close to a point where your genius will not be remarkable, where one can squeeze thoughts more beautiful and clear than you have any hope to achieve from a GPU. If there was ever a time to work on the actually important problems, it is surely now.  

Some may look at ChatGPT's current inadequacies, it's surprising idiocy, and comment it's nowhere close, but that is to fail to recognize progress. "Oh, it only gets a D on this college level Econ exam it had zero minutes to study for, it's not that great!" No, it's not that great. But many existing GPT models are far greater, and they will only get better...And if you play with it for a while, you can often get it to overcome its flubs. 

But what then? In a world where AI will devour your skills, where it overtakes our Tom Swifties slowly and completely, where all of us combined can no longer do anything special? I think Tom Swifties are the point. I resolve to write 10,000 Tom Swifites this year. I hope to become dazzalingly good at them by 2024.

2023-01-19: Do they know what they're talking about?

In cross country, I doubt the coaches are as scientifically versed as we should expect them to be. It is worth doing our own research, and testing out our conclusions on ourselves before we take their advice. Sports medicine, I assume, is prfobably in as bad a state as psychology or nutritional science. It would be best to look at what tribal runners do, not modern athletes (who have short careers and must survive a filter to become famous. Big selection bias!). We spend 0.5 miles warming up for 5 mile runs, while the Tarahumara don't warm up at all for several hundred mile runs. Is stretching some kind of cargo cult practice too? (Yes, I acknowledge a *tribe* of runners is under genetic selection pressures for traits that let them do that, but humans have been running much, *much* longer than we've had those shoes with aerodymanic laces and super rubber that actually *increase* your propensity for injury...).

2023-01-18: batman

The boyhood fantasy of the future being a road to a strong, trained, and archetypal self – samurai, firefighter, astronaut – suddenly seems empty. This notion can still be held, but what then is behind it? In an entropic universe, Batman is a fool, struggling to preserve a corrupted city doomed regardless of the extent of his service to it. Gotham itself is a nebulous entity, as clearly defined as a lake or an ocean. Old residents will move out, while new ones move in, and everyone in its borders is certain to die. Its government will collapse, and it will decay like every city that came before it. His work, and all of ours, amounts to protecting a sand castle from the tide.

People shrivel at the thought that they suffer for reasons other than their stated altruistic motivations. People shrivel at the thought that most people are miserable most of the time, and they refuse to accept it. Have you been to Chili's at 7:00pm on a Friday? Have you gazed upon disconsolate face of your waitress as you place your order for ice water, shaken not stirred? Does it occur to you that most people live at a level of degredation even lower than hers? It is obvious Batman is a child of privillege – when he acts on Gotham's behalf to avert its countless painless death sentences. The mob can only exist because something tempts people to buy their drugs. Every villain can rightly laugh at Bruce Wayne, trying to flush every niche of its vermin so something worse can come and fill it. 

Realizing this only makes the yearning to fearlessly serve a high ordeal stronger. I think meaning is like an air guitar. It is real for the moments when you are strumming it, giving emptiness a shape, implying the existence of the transcendental, but once the music stops, you notice your hands are empty. Sam Harris is a charlatan and a pedant, intent on drying life of its magic with no replacement potion in hand. Except a subscription-based meditation app and a podcast and magic mushrooms.

Some people say the search for meaning is what they find meaningful. Yet meaning is no more than a concept, and once you realize there is nothing outside of that, it all goes silent. I think they killed God, and gave us Sam Harris as a replacement bridgehead to the realms beyond, and this has turned out to be a really bad idea.


2023-01-14: centers

And then I saw it, right before my eyes, inside my heart, the truth; its message reverberating through my every bone and cell. At the lowest level, I was a structure made possible by a kind of energy transfer that required complicated machinery to run. In every microcosom that ran this program, there lied an instruction set – the same one. At the levels above that I was organs and tissue, all following a program laid out by that original design. In that specification was a management software that could handle complex ambiguity and novel stimuli on a time scale faster than the low level machinery itself could account for. A side effect of this program was awareness of *being* a program. Reality, the force modifying symbols on the grandest tape of all, kept on moving, supplying this program with the state transformations it needed to produce this awareness. 

2023-01-14: problems worth fighting for

I said in the previous log entry that extinction is ethical. Sadly, for most humans, we will continue to exist. While that remains true true, there are some problems we have to attend to for the good of all of those who are still alive. 

- Infrastructure for potential solar flare disasters
- Cheaper MRIs
- Low IQ / Intellectual disability 
- Open access
- Cheap and quality training in tough subjects (ramanujan was able to read textbooks on his own and absorb all of mathematics – at the age of 12. the rest of us will need tutoring)
- Nutritional cures to depression (sarah perry reports amelioration of all her mental illnesses after quiting carbs – is such a thing possible for more people? could we make Bryan Johnson's project blueprint available for all?)
- Social acceptance and adoption of synthetic meat, milk, and eggs over organic alternatives (farmed animals have terrible lives)
- Making everyone's life worth living so we don't have to root for the asteroid

There are more problems, but the last one is the most important to me. Is it even possible for life to be worth living? It's what we'll have to fight for...with everything we've got. The time has come for action, for rebellion against our condition. 

2023-01-14: worth living

Most people spend most of their time suffering. If we could make the majority of that time, or even prolonged portions of the day, extremely pleasurable, that would be the greatest good we could do. Dissolve away the suffering masses into bliss...wireheading is the endgame for most people. They would forego reproduction, reducing potential suffering further. Is extinction the ethical opt-out?

I don't know. I think that people are worth fighting for, worth continuing for.

Robin Hanson's overcoming bias bio: 

> In ’77 I began college (UCI) in engineering, but switched to physics to really understand the equations.  Two years in, when physics repeated the same concepts with more math,  I studied physics on my own, skipping the homework but acing the exams.

Coincidentally the same thing all the smart people I know do. 

2023-01-12: why i'm not an antinatalist

While I agree with some very heretical arguments about the value of life and ideal availability of suicide, I don't endorse antinatalism. The reason is that if, say, such a philosophy was to become massively popular, it would first become popular with smarter and ethically concerned people. Most people do not employ so much overhead thought to their decisions. They will not be convinced to rebel against their natural impulses. Now imagine if all the smart and ethically concerned people exited the gene pool. This is not a great argument against antinatalism, nor do I think it is a steelman against what antinatalist proponents say. If you have good genes, you should replicate. We need you.

2023-01-11: life is but a dream

I remember when I first heard those lyrics. I was four years old, sitting on the top floor of a double decker bus. My mom had given me her early generation iPhone to play a simple, brightly colored game. The air was humid. Someone, I can't remember who, was either singing the song or playing it on an old mp3 player. 

This world is constructed by your mind. It is not continuous. You will go to sleep, jumbling up the world generator momentarily. Soon, this moment will become a foggy memory, only a background fact in your story.

[The Last of the Monsters with Iron Teeth](https://carcinisation.com/2014/10/04/the-last-of-the-monsters-with-iron-teeth/):

> The Western child today is mostly kept inside his own home, associating with other children only in highly structured, adult-supervised settings such as school and sports teams. It was not always so. Throughout history, bands of children gathered and roamed city streets and countrysides, forming their own societies each with its own customs, legal rules and procedures, parodies, politics, beliefs, and art. With their rhymes, songs, and symbols, they created and elaborated the meaning of their local landscape and culture, practicing for the adult work of the same nature. We are left with only remnants and echoes of a once-magnificent network of children’s cultures, capable of impressive feats of coordination.

Let's begin anew! Let this notebook be the source of a new culture! Share it with your friends, goad them into organizing. We will fashion new memes, and rituals, and together form a new collective! This burden rests on you, the reader's, shoulders. What do you want the future to be like? Would you like to subject your own children to the plight of today's youth – our functional house arrest? Would you like to watch culture's corpse slowly decompose on the internet? Our pale blue screens as the last respite of human connection in our sparse suburbs? 

I want to build something: software that runs on minds rather than computers. I want to be part of of something greater than my role as a node in a network of instant messages. I want to watch people realize the hole we've found ourselves in, and begin to lay foundation. I want us to awaken to our potential as minds and not as status-obsessed monkeys. 

2023-01-11: communication

> One day, deep within the forest, Agaso, then about 13 years of age, found himself with a rare good shot at a cuscus in a nearby tree. But he only had inferior arrows. Without the slightest comment or solicitation, the straightest, sharpest arrow of the group moved so swiftly and so stealthily straight into his hand, I could not see from whence it came.
>
> At that same moment, Karako, seeing that the shot would be improved by pulling on a twig to gently move an obstructing branch, was without a word already doing so, in perfect synchrony with Agaso’s drawing of the bow, i.e., just fast enough to fully clear Agaso’s aim by millimeters at the moment his bow was fully drawn, just slow enough not to spook the cuscus. Agaso, knowing this would be the case made no effort to lean to side for an unobstructed shot, or to even slightly shift his stance. Usumu similarly synchronized into the action stream, without even watching Agaso draw his bow, began moving up the tree a fraction of a second before the bowstring twanged.

> E. Richard Sorenson, Preconquest Consciousness

I attended a kind of useless workshop on communication yesterday. I am glad I attended it. We are so caught up in this cerebral, rational mode of interaction with the world and each other that it almost seems we have resorted to constructing frameworks for breathing. A certain form of coordination is in-built, perhaps only possible in states of consciousness most of us no longer experience. It is like we are blindfolded. Some people have noticed we can no longer see, and they think the solution is to gouge their own eyes out. 

2023-01-11: aaron swartz

Aaron Swartz was a beacon of light. Read his blog, and you'll get to know him better than you know most of your friends. Encoded in bits is an afterimage of a person fearless to fight for the welfare of all other people.

We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.

I think Sam Kriss's [eulogy of his closest friend](https://samkriss.com) aptly describes the kind of human you find through Aaron's blog:

> There are some people in life that you meet, get on with, hang around with, and drift away from, left with a few objects and a few memories, to moulder or fade away. There are others who cause you to realise, years later, that you’re not at all the same person that you were when you first met them. Their friendship has changed the language you speak, the way you behave, the angle in which you jam yourself into the world. They created you, as much as your own parents did. Anna was that person for me. This might be why losing her feels like being blinded, or having the words seared out of my mouth.

Becoming a person like this is the ultimate goal of life in a futureless world. Someone who lives for others, and in so doing, makes them something more. Someone who can't die, for they've left an imprint of their iridescent and unbelievably insane world model distributed across the thoughts of all those they've touched. The Heidi of the future has dark fantasies. When you can see today's world from an uncorrupted perspective, you're not always going to see virtue, and you're not going to imagine everything is a garden. Yet through that, if you remain unjaded, there's something worth protecting.

I lied. The point of this notebook isn't cultural programming. It's immortality.

2023-01-11: beacons of light

In the absence of the antics of all other people providing a source of meaning or amusement or repository of interestingness, we can try generating our own social Schelling points. Today, you can be a beacon of light by totally devoting yourself to an aesthetic and finding the God in other people and celebrating that. More on this later.

2023-01-11: destigmatizing pleasure

Most people are totally fungible and live their lives hypnotized by social Schelling points of purpose. More so today fewer people are falling for meaningness. All that you can do is make yourself happy. Who still feels like part of a greater collective? Does anyone still respect the collective mind that exists? It acts with no regards to the future.

Narcissism is thinking it's all about you. It now feels like the thing it's all supposed to be about has been abandoned.

I maintain that my interest in certain people comes from their value as world models with faces, and too that it is an aspect of my autistic obsession with understanding exactly what the fuck is going on (in all senses), not at all a desire to know about their personal lives or interact with them. I feel I was handed a disjointed understanding of the world and its relation to the self at birth, and have always had a need to know more about it.

Sarah Perry writes:

> Coordinated punctuality comes at the cost of each person living most of his hours aware of the wider world’s standard time, which is a novel way of being human.

Today's experience of time, and of wasting time, are both novel. Wasting time is a constructed phenomena – the feeling comes from a loss of opportunity for status or something akin – and we tie it to time.

4,000 weeks makes this point in more fluid prose, but I only half-heartedly flipped through the first few pages and stopped reading when the author said he wasn't time-enlightened yet.

2023-01-10: what should we do

Time as a concept is quite strange. In the moment, it's flowing so effortlessly, even counter to your efforts to stop it. You exist, and that's terrifying beyond words. Across days, it's interrupted by sleep and by dreams – which can last varying ammounts of time in the same intervals. You aren't a continuous process, and the only meaningful connection to the last moment is a sense of identification with the memory. 

This begets an important question: what is wasting time? Our motivational system calculates the best ways to fulfill our drives, and sometimes leaves us very unfulfilled beyond momentary satiation. It's using data we don't consciously have access to (eg blood sugar levels), and can cause us to act counter to our best interests. What do we have to feel bad for? What is this feeling of waste, of lost hours? There is merely memory and anticipation and in between is something that's really not that fixed. We live in a waterfall, a cascade of brown noise, and we can never hold on to the sound of one drop of water. We are puppeted by a blind idiot master program designed for savannas now long denuded of grass. How can we but dissasociate from the strings?

What's left to be done? As long as we believe we are in the abyss between a harmonious past and a coordinated future, we can continue making progress. How long can you believe you're still vexed by the brilliant delusion?

2023-01-10: enhanced school

We know that [running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html) may improve the subjective experience. My thoughts as of late have been directed towards finding ways to enhance other activities. The positive super-stimulus problem. Imagine everything you need to do that you hate doing. Now, imagine you felt euphoric while doing them. Melting away into the most banal of tasks, living a life that looks no different than yours right now, but so pleasurable you almost want to suffer again. Perhaps this can be achieved through meditation or simple exercises, such as focusing only on the pleasant aspects of an experience. Those take effort, which is exactly the hurdle. 

How may we do this for the most excrutiatingly boring of tasks: homework? Music makes it more manageable, but it does not unlock the hidden pleasures of reading the political science syllabus. Modafinil users say boring tasks suddenly become wholly absorbing on the drug, though it's not advisable to try. Alexey Guzey reports [working in a virtual office](https://guzey.com/co-working/) provides a measurable boost to his productivity. That may not be a superstimulus, but it sure is an improvement over slavishly plowing through tasks no human will ever need to do again. 

[Join me in my Gather.Town office](https://app.gather.town/invite?token=ZTl-JF5hQ52Wy2XdGk7U) if you want to try it out with me. I'll be there whenever I'm working – on anything.

2023-01-09: flat earthers

From Sam Kriss's [Neil deGrasse Tyson hit piece](https://samkriss.com/2016/03/14/neil-degrasse-tyson-pedantry-in-space/):

> But all this is pedantry, the perverse insistence on how the world is, the total apathy to how it could be different. Pedantry could be broadly defined as a hostility to metaphor, the demand that every object stand for itself and nothing else, that words function in the same way as numbers. Which is why it’s pointless to criticise Neil deGrasse Tyson or the I Fucking Love Scientists for being the pompous, self-important, and utterly cretinous pedants that they are: it’s just falling back into their own dismal, boring logic, insisting that a thing is what it is rather than something else.

Often teachers will only show you a means of symbol manipulation with some definitions: it appears that's all that happens in calculus classes. If you ask your instructor how something works, they will often tell you they don't know. You are told a set of things is supposedly true, and handed a set of instructions that supposedly work. If you believe those things, and painfully contort your brain to work with them (rather than look at them from new directions, and mold them into the perfect shape for understanding to strike you – an approach that may not always result in high scores), they will pin many bright ribbons on your lapel. 

Flat earthers challenge this paradigm. They only accept what they see with their own eyes. They are the last champions of the truth, the last brave souls willing to leave a paradise of pure abstraction and aribtrary facts tagged true by Smart People to enter the triple inferno of Not Knowing, Not Trusting, and Uncertainty. We may never know, and with this crippling fact we must continue! *Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen.*

2023-01-09: walk through the walls

There are some people who are endlessly fascinating. Behind their eyes and between their ears lies a generator of a world like no other. Usually these people are slightly autistic or schizoid or *off* in some way. The prerequisite isn’t their psychiatric classification, but their deviance in how they see things. Most people are handed by society an idea of how other people work, what to believe, what is meaningful, what is virtuous behavior, what they are, and, crucially, what to do. These people are often uninteresting, and mostly so when they’re intelligent. Modern suburban childhood is a very ludic terrarium for developing new white collar workers. The smarter someone is without weird traits, the more likely it is that they’ll overfit to this low-poly simulation of real life. And succeed they will, but see they will not. They’ll follow their innate priors about the world and human behavior, never questioning them – because they work – and they will only ever know things from one view point. If their instincts and innate priors do not guide them well, or if they fail to download social software, they divert more attention to the world around them. Without conditioning tinting their vision, they see things as they are, and come to drastically different conclusions about their environment. 

I want to resist classifying this kind of person, because fitting into a category is precisely what they best fail at, but this is generally what I find makes someone *interesting*. 

Surrounding you are walls. Holding your head is a clamp, stifling attempts to really see. The world you live in often lies to you. I think liberation is finding ways of repurposing the features of your environment for new functions, ones unintended by its designers – be they intelligent, nature, or social forces. See that the walls and clamp aren’t solid objects, but that they are entirely notional. Walk through them! Betray away your category, your unchosen identity. This is your world. It is an open world game much larger than the what the eye implies. Play it your way.

2023-01-09: against spurious sounding claims about things that vaguely correlate

From a PsychToday article entitled "Beautiful People Really Are More Intelligent":

> This mean difference implies a correlation coefficient of r = .381, which is reasonably large in any survey data.

Do you know what an r = .381 looks like on a graph?

![r values](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DzwTH.png)

Does it warrant a claim like "beautiful people are more intelligent"? My focus isn't on the truth of the statement, it's on the wording. What you say affects how other people feel, and if you say things like "thinner people live happier lives, have a better relationship to their bosses, and find cat fur to be softer" to an aneorexic, I don't think that's going to go down very well, regardless of the veracity of the statements. It's so easy to get people to obssess over their intelligence, especially nerds. When that's the only thing about you that could give you status, you're going to think about it a lot. 

I really can't guess whose going to be reading this. Most people aren't constantly thinking about their IQ, and whether it's enough SDs to the right. The people who are (myself included) can't easily unravel themselves from the ever-tightening death spiral, and tend not to be people who *should* be worrying about the implications of their IQ. Whatever self-worth means, everybody knows attractive people are treated differently, intelligent people are more capable, and immutable biological traits determine what the world looks like for you. Maybe you decide your *self-worth*, but you don't always decide your worth otherwise. Should we efface the concept of individual differences from the discourse? Let ourselves be happier rather than right? That never seems to go down well. 

I argue for something else. Let's treat everyone with kindness, even though unconciously we will treat some people more kindly. Let's join together to weather the forever-winter of our shared suffering. No one can extricate from you the horror of being a conscious being, no matter your height, weight, looks, intelligence, or charisma. No one can stop you from being an anxious control freak – well if they could, I doubt you'd care. We exist, often with no viable opt-out, and we deal with that.

2023-01-07: success is totally made up by the way

Adults in guidance positions often talk about success as if it was embedded in the structure of the universe. It kind of isn't. It's made up, and different people have different definitions of it, and you can define it for yourself. You can just decide, right now, that you're successful. Maybe some traits will be good predictors of income or status in the future, so shrewd adults can reasonably say "you'll probably be successful by the current consensus social definition." That's fine, but when they start talking as if it's *destined* to happen or that it's *intrinsic* to you (different than saying you have indicative traits of success) or saying that "all successful people have a fire within" or repeating any other vague truism, issues arise. This universe is very chaotic and random. Predictive traits are just that. *Predictive*. You can intuit some things about causality, like things fall when you drop them, but after that, it's mostly narrative nonsense. Some of the smart people you know will become rigid conformists incapable of having an interesting thought. Some of the slackers will become nauseatingly successful. What's in your hands is how you appraise it all. Happiness, satisfaction, and the giddy inner peace we imagine successful people always feel are all reached through *internal* assessments. You can learn how to change these. Success is always available to you.

2023-01-07: positive super-stimuli

The modern day super-stimuli, as mentioned in the previous post, has, I feel, largely sapped life of transcendental moments, and that most precious trust in one's own impulses to guide the way. We can combat this by creating super-stimuli which pull us in the directions we wish to go. Running while high may just be the beginning of something truly great. Maybe one day, we'll all abandon our distractions, and that pervasive boredom gnawing away at our lives from the inside. The listless blankfaced, deadeyed, disgusted scrolling and refreshing of today will end, and we will wake as if from a dream. We will go outside, we will go to church, we will read more books, we will embark on difficult, meaningful work. And it will not be by force. We will be guided by the beauty of our weapons.

2023-01-07: **stoners, look no further**

Here's all I want to accomplish as a cultural programmer:
- Inpsire someone to build a dating site for the high school (very specific goals with that, won't say them right now)
- Inspire stoners to try running while high 

Let's talk about the second one first.

Sarah Perry [reports her experiences running while high](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/01/enhanced-running.html):

> The solution: superstimulus exercise, exercise that's so good you get addicted to it and have to force yourself to do less of it than you want to. My thesis is that running while high on weed is just this kind of superstimulus exercise. 

> It makes you free. You can go anywhere, and it makes the city feel like your territory. Running while high is an excellent mode of exploration; as a runner, you occupy a well-understood role that is both socially approved and socially ignored. It's the perfect disguise to enable an introvert to move around the world in the sunshine. You can go almost anywhere, even blatantly trespassing, and no one says anything because they barely notice you except to think that they should really start running, too. 
> It's engaging, especially trail running - an ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest, avoiding all the trees efficiently and with perfect concentration.
> It's insanely pleasurable, with every part of your body screaming (in chemicals) that this coordinated motion is exactly what you're supposed to be doing. (Which ties in with the recent discovery that endocannabinoids are probably what causes runner's high. It feels to me like weed jump-starts the process of experiencing exercise as pleasurable, which, even as a life-long athlete, I experienced as much less pleasurable before becoming a stoner.)
> It's transcendent - it often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void," as Haruki Murakami puts it. 

If you are not a stoner, **do not try this**. If you are on the cross country team, **do not try this** (you will get kicked off). If you are me, you will **not be trying this**, since weed has been documented to reduce cognitive performance longterm, and I need that for other reasons. If, however, you have a propensity to behave illicitly, then nothing I say would stop you, no? So why not **try it**? "An ostension of fantasized Imperial speeder bikes maneuvering perfectly through the forest." "It often feels like another being is controlling your body, like you can step away from yourself and "create a void"." **Why are you alive**, if not for these chance moments of communion with the alien minds beneath our feet, of obliteration of the self, of union with Who lives upstairs? Some make the case that such moments were commonplace for our ancestors. There existed no need for an industrial spiritual complex to facillitate them (or, rather, to commoditize, and in so doing, *own* them). Such moments are your birth right. You lived in blissful harmony with the universe as a baby and a child, but you have forgotten how to do this without instruction. The knowledge was wretched from your soft hands so that you would live in lockstep with mankind. They have made a veil, and it is an iron curtain. 

The thing about iron curtains is that they are heavy. They cannot be moved so easily. If you find a way to walk around one, you have found free access to the worlds beyond. Free access is between your finger tips, burning at one end. Free access is your feet rhythmically contacting the ground, melting your corrosive attachments away, stride by stride. 

So. **Hit that blunt, and get outside**, won't you please?

2023-01-07: hello world

If anything, I want this to be an experiment in cultural programming. I don't want to know how many people are reading it, and I don't want to alter anything to appease an abstract audience. I do want to take some the mental models I've made to interpret the world, and install them on your brain. I want to try to cast spells and talk to the spirits that live on the mimetic substrate. Computer programming, as Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman brilliantly put it in their introductory computer science textbook, is the art of instructing magical spirits on a higher plane of existence to do your bidding. With enough computational power available, good programmers are gods. Writing is the same, but with the more ambigous world of distributed thought – culture. Ours is the substrate of mimesis, and we have direct write access into the souls of humans. Slick words can kill a man: show him the world anew through the right nihilistic lens, and he will die by his own hand. Words can imbue meaning into what is just sound and fury, and keep alive those living lives not worth living. They say this skill is innate, that you can't get better. Maybe they're right. Maybe I don't have the talent to pull this off. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm too autistic to do it anyway. Regardless, I'm going to try. 

What do I want to program? Nothing much. Only whatever in the written word constitutes hello worlds and simple binary exploits. I am not malevolent, just curious. Can I create new phrases? A new snowclone! A new cliché! Can I inspire in you doubt in your mental constructs? Hope in what is not real? I do not want to convince you of anything. Argumentation is not programming, but some kind of cultural API layer. 

Let us see where we can take this! Share this page with your friends!
